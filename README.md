# VFlash

A Flash plugin for [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) computers running the [Voyager](https://zapek.com/software/voyager/) browser.

## Supported architectures

- Amiga (68K)
- Amiga PowerUP (PPC)
- MorphOS (PPC)
- CaOS (ColdFire)

## Contributions

Building requires SAS/C for the Amiga 68K version. The others require GCC (2.95 was the last tested one).
It's possible some features need to be enabled again. See the `config.h` file.

Pull requests welcome, but that would surprise me.
